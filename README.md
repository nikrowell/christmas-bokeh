## Then and Now

In 2007, I created an ActionScript 3.0 expirement insipred by the twinkling Christmas lights just outside my window, complete with a screen overlay and Nutcracker ambiance. I decided to revist that experiment using JavaScript as a fun way to see evolution both in the technology and my own approach to creative coding.
